Wifi utilities for finding Huawei routers' default key
======================================================

Some Huawei routers use a default WEP key that is easy findable because
it can be calculated using the MAC address of the router.

Thanks and congrats to the clever people at Websec.mx for figuring out the
generation algorithm after many hours of reverse-engineering.

This repository contains two programs that make use of the discovery.


mac2defaults.py
---------------

This is the original script, improved so that it looks more like Python and
less like C.
The output was also cleaned a bit, and the program can work either in
interactive or automated mode.

- Interactive mode means no command-line parameter was given. The program then
  asks for a MAC address and outputs the corresponding key and default ESSID.
  Then it starts over until an empty address is given.
- When one or several MAC addresses are given on the command line, the program
  outputs the corresponding default key and ESSID in a machine-parseable
  format.

The program works as a Python module so that it can be used by other programs.


scan_vulnerable_aps.py
----------------------

This program scans the available networks around and computes the default WEP
key assuming it's a Huawei modem. If the default ESSID derived from the MAC
matches the actual ESSID, it marks the line with a '*' so that you know the
key will probably work. Otherwise, the line is marked with a '-', which means
it probably won't work, but you can try it anyway, since the ESSID could have
been changed manually.
